# ADR-001: Mock Data Usage for Initial Development

## Status
Accepted

## Context
During the initial scaffolding of the WMS application, we need to demonstrate functionality and UI components before implementing the full backend integration. The backend Azure Functions are implemented but not yet connected to the frontend.

## Decision
We will use mock data in the frontend components initially to:
1. Demonstrate UI functionality
2. Allow frontend development to proceed independently
3. Provide a working prototype for stakeholders
4. Enable UI/UX testing and refinement

## Consequences

### Positive
- Rapid frontend development and iteration
- Immediate visual feedback for stakeholders
- Independent frontend/backend development
- Easy testing of UI components

### Negative
- No real functionality for users
- Technical debt (TD-001) created
- Potential disconnect between mock and real data
- Risk of building UI that doesn't match API contracts

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Mock Data (Current)
- [x] Create mock data structures
- [x] Implement mock data in all components
- [x] Document mock data usage

### Phase 2: API Integration (Next Sprint)
- [ ] Create API service layer
- [ ] Replace mock data with HTTP calls
- [ ] Add error handling
- [ ] Implement loading states

### Phase 3: Real-time Updates (Future)
- [ ] WebSocket integration
- [ ] Real-time data synchronization
- [ ] Offline handling

## Technical Debt
- **TD-001**: No API Integration - High Priority
- **TD-002**: No Error Handling - High Priority
- **TD-004**: No Loading States - Medium Priority
